Dear PayPal member,<br><br>
Due to the attacks to our database last month, we are required to rebuild our system<br>
integrity. We have many reasons to believe that many of our members accounts have<br>
been accessed by a third-party. We strongly recommend you to update your account<br>
as soon as possible.<br><br>
Please understand that this is a security measure intended to protect our members and<br>
their accounts. We are sorry for any inconvenience.<br><br>
However, failure in reviewing and updating your account information will result in<br>
your account suspension.<br><br>
