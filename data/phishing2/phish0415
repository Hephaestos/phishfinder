On eBay, the payment exchange is left up to the buyer and seller. Whenever
possible, use a credit card, because it protects you from losing your money
outright. If for any reason you don't get the item, or it arrives broken or
in a condition other than promised, you then have the credit card company on
your side. 
Don't jump in too fast. Take time to browse through lots of comparable
items, to get a sense of what's out there. 

Start slowly. Begin your eBay adventure by buying a low-priced item. 

Set the maximum price that you will pay for the item. Sometimes during an
auction, buyers get caught up in the "competition." If you think of the
auction in these terms, you could easily end up overpaying. 

If you lose out to another bidder, don't take it personally. 

Keep track of your eBay purchases, and how much you've spent on them.
It's easy to become wrapped up in the eBay game, and it can quickly eat up
both time and money. 

Before you bid, look at the seller's rating. Have other buyers had a good
experience with this particular seller? 

Be skeptical. Items are sometimes sold on eBay for more than their real
value. And although eBay has an internal police force that keeps an eye out
for cheaters, scammers do exist.
