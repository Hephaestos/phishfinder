We recently determined that different multiple login attempts have been ma=
de on <br>
your PayPal account. One employee of our Customer Service has tried to rea=
ch you<br>
by phone. As we did not manage to contact you, this email has been sent to=
<br>
your notice.<br><br>
Therefore your account has been temporary suspended. We need you to confir=
m your <br>
identity in order to regain full privileges of your account. If this is no=
t completed<br>
by May 13, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your =
account<br>
indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes.<br>
<br>
In order to confirm your identity please follow the link below and complet=
e the requested information:<br>
