Here's the Paypal phishing spam that I mentioned this morning.  It looks
fairly legit, even going so far as to pull all of it's images from the
paypal servers, but the premise is pretty suspect (Your account has been
randomly flagged for verification), and the URLs in the actual form are
exploiting the IDN vulnerability.

Enjoy,
