buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs

some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud

teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.</p>



<p>Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your

account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your

account has not been compromised, access to your account was flagged. Your

account will remain flagged until this issue has been resolved.

This is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not

compromised.</p>



<p>In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may

require some specific information from you for the following reason:</p>



<p>Our system requires further account verification.</p>

We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.

Should your account remain flagged for an extended period of time,

it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or

may result in eventual account closure.</p>
