					Your bank has contacted us regarding some attempts of charges from your credit card via the

else has unauthorized access to your Amazon account
                    Due to recent activity, including possible unauthorized listings 
                    placed on your account, we will require a second confirmation 
                    of your identity with us in order to allow us to investigate 
                    this matter further. Your account is not suspended, but if 
                    in 48 hours after you receive this message your account is 
                    not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your Amazon
