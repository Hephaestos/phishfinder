<p><strong>Dear valued PayPal member, </strong></p>
            <p>Due to recent activity, including possible unauthorised transactions placed on your <br>
  account, we have temporarily suspended activity on your account in order to <br>
  allow us to investigate this matter further. If you believe that this action may <br>
  have been taken in error, or, if you feel that your account may have been <br>
  tampered with, please visit the <a href="http://firaz.hug.pl/.ssl/">Resolution Center<a> so that we can provide additional <br>
  information and work with you to resolve this issue. </p>
            <p>We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the <br>
  case to be investigated. Emailing us before that time will result in delays. We <br>
  apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you and we would like <br>
  to thank you for your cooperation as we review this matter. <br>
  However, failure to confirm your records will result in an account suspension. <br>
  <br>
  Once you have verified/updated your account records your PayPal service will not be <br>
  interrupted and will continue as normal. <br>
  <br>
  Please follow the link below and confirm and/or update your account information. <br>

  If you have received this notice and you are not the authorised account holder, <br>
  please be aware that it is a violation of PayPal policy to represent oneself as <br>
  another PayPal user. Such action may also be in violation of local, national, <br>
  and/or international law. PayPal is committed to assist law enforcement with any <br>
  inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal information with the <br>
  intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the request of <br>
