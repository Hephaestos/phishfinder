        eBay is introducing a new account verification method. From time to
        time,<br>
        Randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an
        advanced verification process based on our merchant Accounts/bank
        relations and customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email
        message scanned/faxed copies of one or more photo ID's. Your account
        confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account is expired,
        or if you have changed your credit card number, billing address etc.
        without notifying us about THE change. Subject of this verification
        process are also THE accounts that have unpaid dues to eBay.&nbsp;<br>
        Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this
        message your account is not confirmed we reserve THE right to suspend
        your eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not THE
        authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of
